# Whimsy - Rev0.2

A 40% keyboard with exposed Elite-C/OLED and Rotary encoder.

My first attempt at designing a "proper" custom keyboard. I spent far too long looking at all the amazing new PCB's and custom keyboards being released and having a massive urge to do one for myself. Here is my first attempt.

I've not taken delivery of the physical PCBs as of yet so i can't comment on how well i did, but they will be with me shortly.

**STILL IN DEVELOPMENT - NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION - DO NOT ORDER**
