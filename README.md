# Whimsy - Rev0.5

### Description

Hi, I'm Aidan and I have at least temporarily started working on the Whimsy after it seems like Prkns has abandoned it. As of writing this, Prkns has been inactive on discord for about 4 months with DSA 1930 not being shipped even though it should have been received.

All that I have done is from revision 4 and beyond. I am currently making the Whimsy for myself, but should Prkns not return I will run a group buy on my own. There are currently rev 4 PCBs on their way from JLCPCB, and I will update things once I have made a test build with them. I also plan on making a fully 3D printable version of the case for those who might be interested.

### Plans ðŸ¤”

**rev1:** A working version of the board and an FR4 sandwich case

**rev2:** Tidied up traces and an acrylic case

**rev3:** Prepared for group buy (Prkns went missing at this point)

**rev4:** Fixed issues with OLED connections, added a reset button (Tested and Functional). Uploaded case and plate, both still need some work.

**rev5:** Added compatibility for Nice!Nano (UNTESTED), fixed stupid button position

**OLD DESCRIPTION**

A 40% keyboard with exposed Elite-C/OLED and Rotary encoder.

My first attempt at designing a "proper" custom keyboard. I spent far too long looking at all the amazing new PCB's and custom keyboards being released and having a massive urge to do one for myself. Here is my first attempt.

I've not taken delivery of the physical PCBs as of yet so i can't comment on how well i did, but they will be with me shortly.

**STILL IN DEVELOPMENT - NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION - DO NOT ORDER**
